    "Ans: The methods with a class can be used to access the insatnce variables of its instance. So,the object's state can be modified by its method. Function can't access the attributes of an instance of a class or can't modify the state of the object."

    "### Q6. How much encapsulation (making instance or class variables private) does Python support?\n",
    "Ans: Encapsulation describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an objects variable can only be changed by an objects method."

    "Ans: Reflection method we often encounter the requirement that a method in the executing object, or a variable in the calling object, or a field of the object should be assigned, while the method name or field name can not be determined when encoding the code, and need to be input in the form of passing strings through parameters."
