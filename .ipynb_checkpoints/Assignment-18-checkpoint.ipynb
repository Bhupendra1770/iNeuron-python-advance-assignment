    "Ans: The differences between Text Files and Binary Files are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Text files : are special subset of binary files that are used to store human readable characters as a rich text document or plain text document. Text files also store data in sequential bytes but bits in text file represents characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary files : are those typical files that store data in the form of sequence of bytes grouped into eight bits or sometimes sixteen bits. These bits represent custom data and such files can store multiple types of data (images, audio, text, etc) under a single file."

    "Ans: Text files are less prone to get corrupted as any undesired change may just show up once the file is opened and then can easily be removed. Whereas Use binary files instead of text files for image data."

    "Ans: When a file is opened using the **`with`** keyword, if some exceptions occur after opening a file, or at the end of the file it automatically does the closing of the file. There by not leaving an file in open mode and there would no need to  explicitly close a file."
