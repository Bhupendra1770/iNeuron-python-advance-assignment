    "### Q1. Is it permissible to use several import statements to import the same module? What would the goal be? Can you think of a situation where it would be beneficial ?\n",
    "Ans: Yes, it is permissible to use several import statements to import the same module. It is used in case when we have to import multiple functions from same module. "

    "Ans: One way to avoid mutual importing is to use a design pattern known as the \"Circle-Ellipse\" pattern, in which a module in the circular dependency chain is refactored to import only the specific items it needs from the other module, rather than importing the entire module. This breaks the circular dependency and allows the modules to be imported in a specific order. Another method is to use a 'Facade' pattern, where a single module acts as an interface to the functionality provided by the mutually importing modules, thus avoiding the circular import.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach would be to use an import statement inside a function, so that the import occurs only when the function is called, rather than when the module is imported. This way, the module that is being imported won't be in memory until the function is called and the import statement is executed."

    "Ans: During the time of execution of the code if we want to refer the module in which we are working on then we uses name attribute. In that case it will return the module in which we are working on. Suppose if that moudle is being imported from some other module then name will have the name of that moudle from where the current module has been imported. The current module in which we are working is refer to the string _ _ _main _ _ _."

    "Ans: A program counter (PC) can be useful in an RPN interpreter application as it allows the interpreter to keep track of the current line or instruction being executed, and to move to the next instruction or line of code as appropriate. This can make it easier to debug and troubleshoot the interpreter, as well as to add features such as breakpoints and stepping through the code. Additionally, a PC can also be used to implement features such as subroutines, loops and jump statements, allowing for more complex scripts to be executed with the RPN interpreter."
