    "Ans: When a user enters a stock ticker symbol, there are a few things that can go wrong:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The user may enter an incorrect symbol: This can happen when the user mistypes the symbol or enters the wrong symbol for a company. To handle this, the system can check the entered symbol against a list of known symbols, and if it does not match, prompt the user to enter the correct symbol.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The symbol may not be traded on the exchange: Some companies may not be listed on the exchange. To handle this, the system can check if the symbol is listed on the exchange, and if it's not, inform the user that the symbol is not listed on the exchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The symbol may have been delisted: Some companies may have been delisted from the exchange. To handle this, the system can check if the symbol is still listed on the exchange and if it's not, inform the user that the symbol has been delisted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The stock exchange may be down or unavailable: In some cases, the exchange may be down for maintenance or due to a technical issue. To handle this, the system can check if the exchange is available and, if it's not, inform the user that the exchange is currently unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The symbol may have a different meaning in different markets: Some symbols may have the same name but different meaning in different markets. To handle this, the system can check the market that the user is trying to access and inform the user of the correct symbol for that market.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to handle these issues, a good practice would be to implement input validation and error handling mechanisms that check the entered symbol and inform the user of any issues or inaccuracies. Additionally, having a good source of data and frequently updating it would help to minimize the occurrence of these issues."

    "Ans: \"Indirect importing\" refers to a technique where a module imports another module, which in turn imports the desired module. This is generally considered an anti-pattern as it can make the code more difficult to understand and maintain. Instead, it's better to use the \"direct importing\" method, where the desired module is imported directly, making it clear which modules are being used and how they are related.\n",

    "\n",
    "\" import module1 as alias \"\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, to access any function or attribute in module1, you would use the alias instead of writing the full name of the module.\n"
